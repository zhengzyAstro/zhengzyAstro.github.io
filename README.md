## Welcome to Dr. Zhenya Zheng's Homepage

I am a research professor at [Astrophysics Division of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO)](http://astro-en.shao.cas.cn/members/). I'm leading the research group of "Early Universe and High-redshift Galaxies" at SHAO. I'm also leading SHAO's team in the Multi-Channel Imager project.
